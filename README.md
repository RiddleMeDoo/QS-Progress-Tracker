# QS-Progress-Tracker
Track how much you are progressing in the PBBG called Queslar!

## About
As of the latest updates, it is currently a server that will take API requests to store and retrieve data from the database. It will store a player's game data if the player's API key is provided. A script can store data via the server every day to get a sense of how the player is progressing through the game.

...Please ignore pvp-calc. That was a just an attempt to make a frontend visual calculator using data from the server. It currently does not work.

## Tech used
- Node.js for the backend server
- Express to communicate with the server
- MongoDB for the database
- Mocha and Chai for making unit tests
